package ex_081424.Interface;
//An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
//The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
//It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java
//interfaces can have abstract methods and variables.
//Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
//It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
//we can have default and static methods in an interface.
//we can have private methods in an interface.
//It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
//all the fields are public, static and final by default. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
//methods are public and abstract by default
//a class extends another class, an interface extends another interface, but a class implements an interface.
